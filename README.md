# SpellCast 

Spellcast is an RPG social media where people can create a magickcal persona and collaborate with others to work with and create entities and hyperstitions. Spellcast offers tools for those who wish to advance their abilities in technomancy, and enables a consolidated journal of global dream conversation.

## Tech stack
SpellCast is made with React, MongoDB, NodeJs/Express, and Material UI. Eventually a shift to a relational database is likely to be desirable to facilitate more robust entity relationships.



## Lessons Learned 
I implemented my own auth here for learing purposes using bcrypt. Although this process was interesting and not too difficult, I am still likely to rely on experts when it comes to security. I also used the filesystem throughout this project, so it is very localized, but those skills were good to keep sharp for any non-cloud based projects I work on.
